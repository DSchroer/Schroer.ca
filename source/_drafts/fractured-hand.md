As is usual for me, this year I went back home for the Christmas holidays. It's always a nice time, however I find that it always ends up being busier than expected. This year was no exception. I had the usual family gatherings, drinks with friends and other get togethers. Plus, this year there was one sporty social event. I was invited to join the Tri-Annual Harry and Henney Fun Run. It was a simple event, start the day with a 5k, a 10k or a half marathon and then enjoy a nice breakfast. Seemed simple enough and I didn't put much thought into it. Christmas is busy, it's always like that, so what's the worst that could happen? All I was worried about was a bit of burn out.

The morning of the run was a chilly -10 degrees with a light dusting of snow coming down. A group of around 20 people turned out for the run. There was no particular demographic, just a bunch of running enthusiasts. So as is normal, when the race started, I put on my headphones and began to go at my own pace. I was feeling confident that the 10k would be easy and, for the most part it was. The light snow had covered the trail a little bit, there was also occasionally a small amount of ice. None of that worried me because I was well in the zone by this point. However, just as I reached the 7k turn around point, while thoughts of a good finish were firmly in my mind, I put my foot down onto a bit of black ice without noticing. My feet slid out from under me. I panicked and threw my hands down to catch my fall. I hit the ground hard in two places. First my knee scraped across the cold ground, ripping my pants and my skin. Then down came my hand. It hit the ground square on, it hurt and was stiff, but there was no sense that anything was really wrong. After that I did what came naturally, I got up and kept running. After all, it was just a small fall right?

By the end of the morning, I was pretty convinced that I had sprained my hand. I had sprained things before, so I knew it would swell, it would be sore and it wouldn't move well. I don't know if I played it off too well or everyone else had the same idea. We just went about the day and I put my hand on ice. It swole up as expected but the pain started to get better over time. When it did hurt, I assumed it was normal and that I could just tough it out. After all it was just a bruise, it would get better. Looking back now its easy to see what I did wrong, but I didn't have the experience that I have now. So I kept acting normally, I used my hand a little and iced it a lot. The swelling went down and I figured that I would get better quickly. Before I knew it my trip home was done and I was on my way back home to Montreal.

## Back In Montreal

At first, my time back in Montreal was very uneventful. As expected, I was very exhausted from all the rushing around at home. I cooked, I cleaned and I slept mostly. Did a bit of socializing and a bit of shopping. I really returned to life as normal. My father in law saw my hand, which was still swollen, he was concerned but examined it and concluded that it was probably fine. After all there was almost no pain any more. Just to be safe I did go out and get a brace to support my wrist. I figured that it couldn't really hurt anything.

The real tipping point for me was when I got to work. My boss saw the brace that I was wearing and, he advised me to get it checked out. My other co-workers as well, they gave me a hard time and by the end of the day I was feeling much less confident about my hand. In addition to the self doubt, they also reminded me of a service that we have at the office. It is called EQCare and it is a online medical service. So rather than waiting forever in the emergency room, I could talk to someone that day through the service. 

So that's exactly what I did. By the end of the day I had a referral to get an x-ray. By the next morning, I had my x-rays and was informed that yes, I had a small fracture. Normally I would just leave after that, but I felt compelled to see what my fracture was like. So I talked to the staff at the radiology clinic and asked for a copy of my images. In the end they agreed, and I left with both the knowledge of a fractured hand, and a CD containing the original images. Little did I know, but that CD would be one of the most useful tools I could have.

## CHUM

In Montreal, just like most major cities, there are a lot of hospitals. So when my doctor on EQCare told me that I should "Go to emergency right now", I headed directly for the biggest and newest hospital that I knew about.

* Always ask for copies of your key medical documents. Especially when moving between facilities.
* If its more than a scratch, get it checked out
* The biggest hospital is not always the best
* If the doctor seems unsure, do what you can to find a specialist
