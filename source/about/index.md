## About Me

Interested in technology for as long as I can remember. Growing up in a complex engineering and academic household has taught me to always be curious and that every problem has a solution. Thanks to the experience of working on a range of projects from drone automation to security applications to game development, I have learned to adapt to any challenge that comes my way.
