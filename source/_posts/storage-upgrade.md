I have been using my Lenovo N22 Chromebook running linux for a couple of months now. It is an extremely convenient laptop for travel, school and even personal projects. I have even been able to use the recently released Vulkan graphics API, just to show how capable these little laptops are. Unfortunatley there is one small problem that has been bothering me.
