			Racket Handin Protocol
		</h2>
	</a>

	<div class="markdown-body">
		<p>I will be documenting the Racket handin client protocol. By going over all of the functionality included in the protocol, I hope that it will be useful to others. The handin application is used to submit racket applications to a professor for marking. It is normally downloaded as a *.plt file that is a plugin for the DrRacket editor. This information should be useful for people who wish to port the application to other development environments than DrRacket.</p>
<p>The original handin client and server code can be found here:<br><a href="https://github.com/racket/handin">Handin Source</a></p>
<h2 id="Disclaimer"><a href="#Disclaimer" class="headerlink" title="Disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h2><p>Since this information was obtained mostly by reading the racket source and<br>looking at packet captures, this protocol documentation is my best guess and by no means official. I was simply unable to find information on the protocol in any other form and have decided to provide my own documentation for others. I am providing this information under the following disclaimer:</p>

		<h2>
			Why Not TypeScript
		</h2>
	</a>

	<div class="markdown-body">
		<p>Recently I looked into TypeScript. I had been working on a project that was growing rapidly. The downside was that the project was breaking continuously. We needed a way to fix it. TypeScript seemed like a good idea but we had our reservations.</p>
<p>Turns out TypeScript was the perfect solution for us. It strengthened our code base and reduced the number of bugs we introduced.<br>

			Installing .NET core on Arch Linux
		</h2>
	</a>

	<div class="markdown-body">
		<p>As both a .NET developer and a Linux enthusiast, I jumped when I learned that Microsoft was releasing the coreclr tool chain. However it turns out that using it with Arch Linux is not as simple as one would hope. I made this guide to help people setup the basic tools in order to develop using the latest .NET framework on Arch Linux.</p>
<p>This post is now outdated. You can just install .NET core directly from the AUR and it will work fine. I am keeping this post up in case it will help someone troubleshoot problems.<br>
